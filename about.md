# Who are you?

My name is Julien Benoit. I live in Paris where I am engineer at [SII Ile-de-France](http://idf.groupe-sii.com/fr). I help our customers to build better applications with PHP, JavaScript and HTML5. I enjoy working with the latest libraries and frameworks. I graduated from a french engineering school. My interests goes far beyond software development. I love to travel, eat good food and drink fine wine (probably because I am french!).
